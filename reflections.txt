Using Diff to Find Bugs

fc and diff are ok, but I would rather use something with a nice UI

Using History for Efficiency

I hate refelecting.
History should make it easier to find newly introduced bugs and recovery from
disaster.

Manual Commits

Cons: Will forget to commit.  Breaks creative flow.
Pros: Commits mosr useful down the road if ever needed.

Using Git to View History

Use git log to identify what you want to diff.
Use git diff commit1id commit2id to start the diff.

Confidence from Version Control

It so easy to go back that I might as well go ahead and break everything!

How Do You Want To Use Git

My Job.
